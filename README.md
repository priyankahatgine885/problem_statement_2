Question : 

Average marks scored across all subjects by the student with the lowest ID
Consider this Java Program. The input is in this format:

22, Data Structures, 45
23, English, 52
22, English, 51
26, Data Structures, 72
23, Data Structures, 61
24, English, 81

Each line consists of three fields "Student ID," "Subject," and "Marks."
"Student ID" and "Marks" are integers and "Subject" is a string that does not contain commas or newlines. 
There can be any number of students and up to 6 subjects.

You have to modify processData to compute the average marks scored across all subjects by the student with the lowest ID.
